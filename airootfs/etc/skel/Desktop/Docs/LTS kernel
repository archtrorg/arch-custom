Warning! Backup all your files to avoid undesirable side effects!

All commands to type into terminal are written after $ sign.
Open up terminal and run following commands:

# Check which version of kernel your system runs:
$ uname -r

# If it is not an LTS version:
$ pac linux-lts linux-lts-headers
$ reboot

# Now your system should have the lts version enabled by default:
$ uname -r

# I do not advise to remove another version of kernel, but if you really want to:
$ pacr linux linux-headers

## There may also be a problem with grub, and it may start to boot into blind mode.
## Then you should fix your screen resolution in grub configuration file (/etc/default/grub).
## To do this, use Arch live-usb/cd (you may use my live version if you want to), and then:

# Mount root partition (where # is a number of your device):
$ mount /dev/sda# /mnt 

# Mount boot partition (where # is a number of your device):
$ mount /dev/sda# /mnt/boot

# Change root directory:
$ arch-chroot /mnt

## If you wish to try to fix grub, then:
# Open any text editor and replace the line which contains GRUB_GFXMODE="auto" with your screen's resolution (e.g.: GRUB_GFXMODE="1920x1080"):
$ nano

# Exit root and reboot:
$ exit
$ reboot

## If you wish to return to the old kernel, then:
# Reinstall old kernel:
$ pac linux linux-headers

# Exit root and reboot:
$ exit
$ reboot
